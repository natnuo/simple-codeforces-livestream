<h2>Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è</h2>

Time to complete: ~5 minutes

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- Have Node.js (and NPM) installed
- Have a Codeforces account (if you don't, then what are you doing here?)

<h3>Obtaining a Codeforces API Key üîë</h3>

Navigate to <a href="https://codeforces.com/settings/api">https://codeforces.com/settings/api</a> and add a new Codeforces API Key. Save the key and the secret.

<h3>Obtaining the Software üíª</h3>

Clone this repository:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/natnuo/simple-codeforces-livestream.git</pre>

Alternatively, download and extract the zip from our <a href="https://github.com/natnuo/simple-codeforces-livestream/releases/tag/v1.0.0">releases</a>.

<h3>Linking the Codeforces API Key (and Secret) üîó</h3>

You need to add your Codeforces API Key and Secret as environment variables. In Windows, this can be done by searching in the taskbar for <i>"Edit the system environment variables"</i>, clicking <i>"Environment Variables..."</i>, then 
adding new user variables (there are ways described online to add environment variables on other operating systems as well). You need to add the following values:

1. <b>Name:</b> <code>CODEFORCES_API_KEY</code>, <b>Value:</b> <i>Your Codeforces API Key</i>
2. <b>Name:</b> <code>CODEFORCES_API_SECRET</code>, <b>Value:</b> <i>Your Codeforces API Secret</i>

After adding the variables, restart your terminal if it is currently open.

<h3>Editing Settings ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>

Open a terminal at the repository's root (or the extracted folder's root, if you chose to download the zip). Execute <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run setup</code>.

Main features must be edited every time you change the contest you wish to livestream. Open the main features now.

The Contest ID can be found in the URL of the contest page. For example, the contest: <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/2013">https://codeforces.com/contest/2013</a> has a Contest ID of <code>2013</code>, and the gym <a href="https://codeforces.com/gym/105404">https://codeforces.com/gym/105404</a> has a Contest ID of <code>105404</code>. Mashup Contest ID values can be found similarly to that of gyms.

For the "Problem List" setting, list each problem's code (e.g. <code>"A"</code>, <code>"C"</code>, <code>"F2"</code>), along with the HEX color code you want to associate with that problem. The keys in "Problem List" must exactly match the problems in the chosen contest or the livestream will not display correctly. Your input must match the format of the default value.

If you are using <code>localhost:3000</code> for another program, you may change the port our software uses by editing the <code>PORT</code> setting under the Functional Features.

For the settings about "reload times", do NOT reload more than once every two seconds, or you will recieve errors.

PLEASE SAVE YOUR SETTINGS BEFORE EXITING THE SETUP SCRIPT.

<h3>Building and Starting the Server üé¨</h3>

Next, run <code>npm start</code>. The program must be running each time you wish to run a livestream with TLE Live.

<h3>Connecting to your Livestream ‚≠ê</h3>

For the purposes of this tutorial, I will use OBS Studio for live streaming.

Within OBS, create a new <i>"Browser"</i> source.

If you want to add the live-updating submissions queue (list of recent submissions) to your live stream, then set your URL as <code>http://localhost:3000/status</code> (change the port if applicable). For the status page (the page with the submissions queue), a general resolution of 380x800 is recommended, though other values may work better for your specific purposes and depending on the number of submission you choose to display.

If you want to add the live-updating standings page to your live stream, then set your URL as <code>http://localhost:3000/standings</code> (once again, change the port if applicable). For the standings page, a general resolution of 1000x700 is recommended, though other values may work better for your specific purposes and depending on the number of standings you choose to display.

That's it! Now you have live-updating information from Codeforces, in your live stream! Nice.

Each time you want to display a different contest, you can
1. run <code>npm run setup</code>,
2. edit the Main Features,
3. exit and execute <code>npm start</code>, then
4. refresh your OBS <i>"Browser"</i> source until the widget loads.

Simple as that.

Please create an issue in this GitHub repository for bug reports.

Thank you to Mike Mirzayanov for the great Codeforces platform.

Note 1: Codeforces has banned the use of their API during some official Codeforces contests. Ensure your livestream does not occur during such an event to avoid errors.

Note 2: Do not set your refresh times too low, as will overquery the Codeforces API and may result in your key being restricted.

Note 3: IOI-style contests are untested and likely buggy. IOI or not, please test on a mock contest before using this software for important events.
